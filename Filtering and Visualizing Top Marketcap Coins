3. How big is Bitcoin compared with the rest of the cryptocurrencies?
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is under serious competition from other projects, but it is still dominant in market capitalization. Let's plot the market capitalization for the top 10 coins as a barplot to better visualize this.
In [58]:

#Declaring these now for later use in the plots
TOP_CAP_TITLE = 'Top 10 market capitalization'
TOP_CAP_YLABEL = '% of total cap'
​
# Selecting the first 10 rows and setting the index
cap10 = cap[:10].set_index('id')
​
# Calculating market_cap_perc
cap10 = cap10.assign(market_cap_perc = lambda x: (x.market_cap_usd/cap.market_cap_usd.sum())*100)
​
# Plotting the barplot with the title defined above 
ax = cap10.market_cap_perc.plot.bar(title=TOP_CAP_TITLE)
​
# Annotating the y axis with the label defined above
ax.set_ylabel(TOP_CAP_YLABEL)
# ... YOUR CODE FOR TASK 4 ...
Out[58]:
Text(0,0.5,'% of total cap')
